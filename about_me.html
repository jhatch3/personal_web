    <p class="about_me_p" style="text-indent: 30px;">
      I am a fourth-year Computer Science student at the University of Oregon, specializing in Machine Learning, Data Science, 
      and Artificial Intelligence, with a minor in Math. I look forward to expanding my knowledge and gaining hands-on 
      experience in the field.<br>
    </p>
      
    <p class="about_me_p" style="text-indent: 30px;">
      Currently, I am a Student Accountant with the University of Oregon Housing Department, where I specialize in data entry 
      for over 70 vendors, ensuring accuracy and completeness. I count and reconcile cash for more than 20 dining vendors,
      maintaining financial accuracy and integrity. I also support statement reconciliation and invoice research to improve
      financial operations. Additionally, I have created Power BI reports to analyze trends in invoice payments for specific 
      vendors.<br>

    <p class="about_me_p" style="text-indent: 30px;">
      This summer, I am studying to earn the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02) certification. I am also completing 
      DataCamp’s Associate Data Engineer in SQL career track, where I’m learning the fundamentals of data engineering, 
      including databases, database design, data lakes, data warehouses, pipelines, SQL, and Snowflake. 
      After finishing the SQL track, I will begin the Associate Data Engineer in Python program, where I’ll apply what I’ve 
      learned using tools like Apache Airflow, cloud platforms, and CI/CD techniques. I will also start studying for AWS Certified 
      AI Practitioner (AIF-C01) certification. In parallel, I am also taking the Global Career Accelerator class through the University of Oregon, 
      where I will gain real-world experience by working with organizations such as Charity: Water and Intel. I’ll be learning about branding and 
      marketing while deploying thoughtfully designed landing pages using GitHub, HTML, and CSS, and enhancing my work through AI 
      prompting with ChatGPT. Additionally, I will dive deep into data by conducting a Sustainability Impact Analysis for Intel
       using Excel.<br>
    </p>

    <p class="about_me_p" style="text-indent: 30px;">
      I’m actively seeking opportunities in Data Engineering, Machine Learning/AI Engineering, or Data Science. I’m open to roles 
      across all industries and bring strong motivation and a passion for learning to every opportunity. If you know 
      of any openings, feel free to connect or message me on LinkedIn.
