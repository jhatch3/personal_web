  <h2 id="index_about_me_header">About Me</h2>
  <div class="index_about_me_div">
      <p id="index_about_me_p" style="text-indent: 30px;">
        I am a fourth-year Computer Science student at the University of Oregon, specializing in Machine Learning, Data Science, 
        and Artificial Intelligence, with a minor in Math. I look forward to expanding my knowledge and gaining hands-on experience in the field.
        Currently, I am a Student Accountant with the University of Oregon Housing Department, where I specialize in data entry for over 70 vendors, 
        ensuring accuracy and completeness. I count and reconcile cash for more than 20 dining vendors, maintaining financial accuracy and integrity. I
        also support statement reconciliation and invoice research to improve financial operations. Additionally, I have created Power BI reports to analyze 
        trends in invoice payments for specific vendors.
      </p>

      <p id="index_about_me_p" style="text-indent: 30px;">
        My relevant skills include, but are not limited to:
        Python, Data Science Concepts, Data Engineering Concepts, Pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy, SQL, 
        Microsoft 365 Apps, Power BI, Data Management in Excel and Python, Data Collection, 
        Data Cleaning, C, C++, Git, HTML, and CSS. 
      </p>
