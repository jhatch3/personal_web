      <h6>Evaluated Machine Learning Models for Customer Churn Prediction</h6>
      <p id="Project_p">
        - Performed data preprocessing, including cleaning and feature engineering, to prepare a structured dataset for supervised learning tasks. <br> <br>
        - Implemented and fine-tuned multiple classification algorithms, including Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP). <br><br>
        - Conducted hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV and cross-validation to enhance model performance. <br><br>
        - Compared models using key evaluation metrics, with a focus on F1 Score to balance precision and recall for imbalanced data. <br><br>
        - Wrote a technical report outlining methodology, model performance analysis.

      <h6>Python Script to Help Automate Invoice Reconciliation</h6>
      <p id="Project_p">
        - Developed a Python script to streamline the invoice reconciliation process by comparing datasets from .xlsm Excel file. <br> <br>
        - Utilized python to read, clean, and manipulate financial data for efficient analysis.<br> <br>
        - Automated the detection of discrepancies, including mismatches in invoice totals and missing entries across datasets.<br> <br>
        - Implemented logic for exception reporting, flagging unmatched records for further review to reduce manual reconciliation effort. <br> <br>
        - Improved reconciliation accuracy and processing time, supporting the finance/accounting workflow. <br> <br>
