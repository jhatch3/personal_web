      <h6 class="project_h6" >Evaluated Machine Learning Models for Customer Churn Prediction</h6>
      <p id="Project_p">
        - Performed data preprocessing, including cleaning and feature engineering, to prepare a structured dataset for supervised learning tasks. <br> <br>
        - Implemented and fine-tuned multiple classification algorithms, including Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP). <br><br>
        - Conducted hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV and cross-validation to enhance model performance. <br><br>
        - Compared models using key evaluation metrics, with a focus on F1 Score to balance precision and recall for imbalanced data. <br><br>
        - Wrote a technical report outlining methodology, model performance analysis.

      <p id="Project_p">
        - Developed a Python script to streamline the invoice reconciliation process by comparing datasets from .xlsm Excel file. <br> <br>
        - Utilized python to read, clean, and manipulate financial data for efficient analysis.<br> <br>
        - Automated the detection of discrepancies, including mismatches in invoice totals and missing entries across datasets.<br> <br>
        - Implemented logic for exception reporting, flagging unmatched records for further review to reduce manual reconciliation effort. <br> <br>
        - Improved reconciliation accuracy and processing time, supporting the finance/accounting workflow. <br> <br>

  <div class="index_about_me_div">
      <p id="index_about_me_p" style="text-indent: 30px;">
        I am a fourth-year Computer Science student at the University of Oregon, specializing in Machine Learning, Data Science, 
        and Artificial Intelligence, with a minor in Math. I look forward to expanding my knowledge and gaining hands-on experience in the field.
        Currently, I am a Student Accountant with the University of Oregon Housing Department, where I specialize in data entry for over 70 vendors, 
        ensuring accuracy and completeness. I count and reconcile cash for more than 20 dining vendors, maintaining financial accuracy and integrity. I
        also support statement reconciliation and invoice research to improve financial operations. Additionally, I have created Power BI reports to analyze 
        trends in invoice payments for specific vendors.
      </p>
